## Methodology
1. **Video Input**: Real-time video streams from surveillance cameras or pre-recorded videos are used as input to the system.
2. **Background Subtraction**: Background subtraction algorithms, such as Gaussian Mixture Models or Kernel Density Estimation, are applied to identify moving objects in the video frames.
3. **Object Tracking**: Detected objects are tracked across consecutive frames using techniques like Kalman filtering or optical flow to maintain their identity and trajectory.
4. **Suspicious Activity Detection**: Predefined rules and heuristics are applied to the tracked objects to identify suspicious activities, such as loitering, unusual motion patterns, or unauthorized access.
5. **Alerting and Notification**: When suspicious activities are detected, the system generates alerts and notifications in real-time, enabling prompt security responses.

## Results
- The Intelligent Thief Detection System demonstrated high accuracy in detecting and localizing potential intruders in real-time video streams.
- The background subtraction algorithms effectively identified moving objects, even in challenging lighting conditions and dynamic environments.
- The object tracking methods successfully maintained the identity and trajectory of detected objects, enabling accurate monitoring and analysis of their activities.
- The system's real-time processing capabilities allowed for prompt detection and alerting of suspicious activities, facilitating timely security interventions.
