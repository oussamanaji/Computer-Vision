## Methodology
1. **Face Detection**: The Haar Cascade classifier is used to detect faces in real-time video frames captured from the webcam.
2. **Mask Preprocessing**: The cartoon-style mask image is loaded and preprocessed to ensure proper alignment and blending with the detected faces.
3. **Face Masking**: For each detected face, the cartoon mask is resized to fit the face dimensions and applied using alpha blending techniques.
4. **Real-Time Video Processing**: The processed frames with the applied cartoon masks are displayed in real-time, creating an interactive and engaging user experience.
5. **Performance Optimization**: The code is optimized to ensure efficient processing and smooth real-time performance, minimizing latency and resource consumption.

## Results
- The Real-Time Cartoon Filter with Face Detection successfully applies cartoon-style masks to detected faces in real-time video streams.
- The Haar Cascade classifier accurately detects faces in various lighting conditions and orientations, enabling reliable face masking.
- The cartoon masks are seamlessly blended with the detected faces, creating a visually appealing and entertaining effect.
- The system achieves real-time performance, providing a smooth and responsive user experience without noticeable lag or delays.
