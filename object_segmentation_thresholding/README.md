- Image Processing
- Python
- Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, scikit-image

## Applications
- Object Recognition and Tracking
- Image Analysis and Understanding
- Medical Image Segmentation
- Autonomous Systems and Robotics

## Methodology
1. **Image Loading**: The input image is loaded using OpenCV's `imread` function and converted to grayscale for further processing.
2. **Thresholding Techniques**:
   - **Binary Thresholding**: A fixed threshold value is used to separate the object from the background.
   - **Adaptive Thresholding**: The threshold value is adaptively determined based on the local neighborhood of each pixel.
   - **Otsu's Thresholding**: An optimal global threshold is automatically computed based on the image histogram.
   - **Multi-Otsu Thresholding**: Multiple threshold values are determined to segment the image into multiple regions.
   - **Local Thresholding**: The threshold value is adapted based on the local neighborhood of each pixel.
   - **Hysteresis Thresholding**: Two threshold values are used to create a more robust segmentation by considering pixel connectivity.
3. **Post-processing**: Additional post-processing steps, such as morphological operations or contour analysis, can be applied to refine the segmentation results.
4. **Visualization**: The segmented objects are visualized using OpenCV's drawing functions or by displaying the binary mask.
